I created two filepaths under ProjectThree for this assignment. The first filepath is for the postfix expression manager. The second filepath is for the queue.

The only files you should need are the .cpp and .h files for each respective part of the assignment.

Both projects text user input. For the expression manager please type in any expression you'd like to convert to postfix in the prompt and it should do it accurately as outlined in the assignment. For the queue, you will be given a menu of choices to modify or check the queue along with a final choice to exit the file. Use this as you'd like to test the queue functionality.

My screenshots from running the expression manager application in terminal:
